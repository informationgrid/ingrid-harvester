? Would you like to remove TSLint and its related config if there are no TSLint projects remaining after this conversion? Yes
? Would you like to ignore the existing TSLint config? Recommended if the TSLint config has not been altered much as it makes the new ESLint config cleaner. No
    
    INFO: We are now installing the "tslint-to-eslint-config" package into a tmp directory to aid with the conversion
    
    This may take a minute or two...
    
    
    WARNING: Within "tslint.json", the following 4 rule(s) did not have known converters in https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config
    
      - use-host-property-decorator
      - use-input-property-decorator
      - use-life-cycle-interface
      - use-output-property-decorator
    
    You will need to decide on how to handle the above manually, but everything else has been handled for you automatically.
    
    
    INFO: To most closely match your tslint.json, the `latest` version of the following eslint plugin(s) have been installed:
    
      - eslint-plugin-import
      - eslint-plugin-jsdoc
      - eslint-plugin-prefer-arrow
    
    Please note, you may wish to pin these to a specific version number in your package.json, rather than leaving it open to `latest`.
